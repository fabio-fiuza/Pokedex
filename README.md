## Description

I'm developing a tool that allows you to search, display and compare pokemon stats.
The project was divided into 3 parts:
- Data extraction
- Data cleaning
- Web app construction

#### Data extraction
In the first step, we will extract the Pok√©mon data contained in the https://pokemondb.net website.

#### Data cleaning 
In this step we will identify, correct and remove errors, inconsistencies and problems in the data.

#### Web app construction
Finally, we are going to create an interactive application capable of searching, displaying and comparing statistics about pokemons.
